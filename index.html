              technical festival of BITS Pilani.

            <p>Crafted and conducted by the students of BITS Pilani under the guidance of a dedicated panel
              of professors, the paper will have one unified theme based on the various extraordinary
              scientific phenomenons at the boundaries of human scientific achievement, which can be
              understood and solved using a reasonable amount of knowledge in basic sciences and logical
              reasoning.

                 We also made a mark at the international stage with participation from Abu Dhabi and Germany.
                 This year we are expanding our reach to over 30 cities with over 100 BITS Pilani associates and an estimated participation of over 10,000 students.

                  something new from the paper. The paper will have one unifying theme based on recent
                  scientific breakthroughs and phenomena. The answers will be in the questions itself (your

                  you don’t require any extra knowledge to get to the answers, and you can find them with what
