            <p>Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani is one of the premier engineering colleges in the country. 
                APOGEE is the annual, international technical festival of BITS Pilani and we are proud to announce that we are back with the 37th edition of one of the largest technological symposiums.
                Apart from a melange of technical events, Apogee also hosts Aarohan, a Pan-India school level examination.
            </p>

            <p>Crafted and conducted by the students of BITS Pilani under the guidance of a dedicated panel of professors,
                the paper will have one unified theme based on the various extraordinary scientific phenomenons at the boundaries of human scientific achievement,
                which can be understood and solved using a reasonable amount of knowledge in basic sciences and logical reasoning.
                The aim is to inculcate the much needed scientific temperament.
            </p>

            <p>Since its inception in 2012, what started off as a humble attempt to rekindle curiosity is now a nationwide event.
                 We also made a mark at the international stage with participation from Abu Dhabi and Germany.
                 This year we are expanding our reach to over 30 cities with over 100 BITS Pilani associates and an estimated participation of over 10,000 students.
